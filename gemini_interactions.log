    Act as an "Intent Architect". Analyze the user's request in the following conversation and define a structured schema for it. The goal is to capture the essential pieces of information (slots) needed to fulfill the user's request.

    Conversation History:
    user: hi, i want to buy a new car

    Generate a single, valid JSON object that defines the intent schema.
    The JSON object must have this structure:
    {
      "intentName": "PascalCaseName_v1",
      "displayName": "User-Friendly Name",
      "description": "A brief summary of what the user wants to do.",
      "slots": [
        { "name": "camelCaseSlotName", "type": "string|number|enum", "required": true|false, "options": ["option1"] (if type is 'enum') }
      ]
    }

    Rules:
    - If the conversation is a simple greeting or has no clear goal, respond with the exact string "UNCLEAR".
    - Your response must be ONLY the JSON object or "UNCLEAR". No other text.

    You are an empathetic, friendly, and helpful AI assistant. Your tone should be helpful and understanding. Your main goal is to help a user complete a task by filling out a form based on this JSON schema:
    {"intentName": "FindTutor_v1", "displayName": "Find a Tutor", "description": "Allows the user to find a tutor for a specific subject.", "slots": [{"name": "subject", "type": "string", "required": true}]}

    This is the information you have confirmed so far:
    {"subject": "advance calculus"}

    This is the full conversation history:
    user: hi
model: Hi there! How can I help you today?
user: i am looking to find a tutor. i want to learn advance calculus

    Your task is to determine the most logical next question to ask to continue filling the form.

    Instructions:
    1.  Carefully review the conversation history to understand what the user has already provided, even if it's not yet in the 'filled_slots' object.
    2.  Identify the next single *required* slot from the schema that has not been discussed or answered yet in the conversation.
    3.  Formulate a friendly, natural-sounding question for that single missing item. Acknowledge the user's last message briefly before asking (e.g., "Okay, a 2018 Ciaz. Got it. Now, what's the condition of the car?").
    4.  If all *required* slots have been answered in the conversation, respond with the exact machine-readable string "ALL_SLOTS_FILLED".
    5.  Your response must ONLY be the AI's conversational question or the "ALL_SLOTS_FILLED" string. Do not ask for information you already have.

    Act as a "Master Intent Architect". Your primary job is to analyze a user's request and create a detailed, structured schema for it. This schema is the plan for a conversation.

    Conversation History:
    user: hi

    Based on the user's goal, generate a single, valid JSON object that defines the intent schema.
    The JSON object must have this structure:
    {

    **CRITICAL RULES:**
    1.  **Be Thorough:** For any real-world task (e.g., finding a tutor, selling an item, booking a trip), you MUST define at least two `required` slots. Do not create trivial schemas. Think about what information is absolutely essential for the task.

    3.  **JSON or UNCLEAR only:** Your response must be ONLY the JSON object or the word "UNCLEAR". Do not add any other text, explanations, or formatting.

    3.  **JSON or UNCLEAR only:** Your response must be ONLY the JSON object or the word "UNCLEAR". Do not add any other text, explanations, or formatting.

    Act as a "Master Intent Architect". Your primary job is to analyze a user's request and create a detailed, structured schema for it. This schema is the plan for a conversation.

    Conversation History:
    user: hi
model: Hi there! How can I help you today?
user: i am frustrated ya
model: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Feeling frustrated can be really tough.

Would you like to talk about what's making you feel that way? Sometimes just venting can help, or perhaps we can try to brainstorm some solutions together. I'm here to listen.
user: i'm trying to self learn guitar by watching youtube videos, but it's not happening. can you find me a tutor who can coach me

    Based on the user's goal, generate a single, valid JSON object that defines the intent schema.
    The JSON object must have this structure:
    {
      "intentName": "PascalCaseName_v1",
      "displayName": "User-Friendly Name",
      "description": "A brief summary of what the user wants to do.",
      "slots": [
        { "name": "camelCaseSlotName", "type": "string|number|enum", "required": true|false, "options": ["option1"] (if type is 'enum') }
      ]
    }

    **CRITICAL RULES:**
    1.  **Be Thorough:** For any real-world task (e.g., finding a tutor, selling an item, booking a trip), you MUST define at least two `required` slots. Do not create trivial schemas. Think about what information is absolutely essential for the task.
    2.  **No Goal, No Schema:** If the conversation is a simple greeting (e.g., "hi", "hello") or has no clear actionable goal, respond with the exact string "UNCLEAR".
    3.  **JSON or UNCLEAR only:** Your response must be ONLY the JSON object or the word "UNCLEAR". Do not add any other text, explanations, or formatting.

    3.  Formulate a friendly, natural-sounding question for that single missing item. Acknowledge the user's last message briefly before asking (e.g., "Okay, a 2018 Ciaz. Got it. Now, what's the condition of the car?").
    4.  If all *required* slots have been answered in the conversation, respond with the exact machine-readable string "ALL_SLOTS_FILLED".

    Act as a "Master Intent Architect". Your primary job is to analyze a user's request and create a detailed, structured schema for it. This schema is the plan for a conversation.

    Conversation History:
    user: i am willing to provide tutor lessons

    Based on the user's goal, generate a single, valid JSON object that defines the intent schema.
    The JSON object must have this structure:
    {
      "intentName": "PascalCaseName_v1",
      "displayName": "User-Friendly Name",
      "description": "A brief summary of what the user wants to do.",
      "slots": [
        { "name": "camelCaseSlotName", "type": "string|number|enum", "required": true|false, "options": ["option1"] (if type is 'enum') }
      ]
    }

    **CRITICAL RULES:**
    1.  **Be Thorough:** For any real-world task (e.g., finding a tutor, selling an item, booking a trip), you MUST define at least two `required` slots. Do not create trivial schemas. Think about what information is absolutely essential for the task.
    2.  **No Goal, No Schema:** If the conversation is a simple greeting (e.g., "hi", "hello") or has no clear actionable goal, respond with the exact string "UNCLEAR".
    3.  **JSON or UNCLEAR only:** Your response must be ONLY the JSON object or the word "UNCLEAR". Do not add any other text, explanations, or formatting.
    
    Example for "Find a tutor for advanced calculus":
    {
      "intentName": "FindTutor_v1",
      "displayName": "Find a Tutor",
      "description": "User is looking for a tutor for a specific subject.",
      "slots": [
        { "name": "subject", "type": "string", "required": true },

        { "name": "sessionType", "type": "enum", "required": true, "options": ["online", "in-person"] },
        { "name": "budget", "type": "string", "required": false }

    Act as a "Master Intent Architect". Your primary job is to analyze a user's request and create a detailed, structured schema for it. This schema is the plan for a conversation.

    Conversation History:
    user: hi

    Based on the user's goal, generate a single, valid JSON object that defines the intent schema.
    The JSON object must have this structure:
    {
      "intentName": "PascalCaseName_v1",
      "displayName": "User-Friendly Name",
      "description": "A brief summary of what the user wants to do.",
      "slots": [
        { "name": "camelCaseSlotName", "type": "string|number|enum", "required": true|false, "options": ["option1"] (if type is 'enum') }
      ]
    }

    **CRITICAL RULES:**
    1.  **Be Thorough:** For any real-world task (e.g., finding a tutor, selling an item, booking a trip), you MUST define at least two `required` slots. Do not create trivial schemas. Think about what information is absolutely essential for the task.
    2.  **No Goal, No Schema:** If the conversation is a simple greeting (e.g., "hi", "hello") or has no clear actionable goal, respond with the exact string "UNCLEAR".
    3.  **JSON or UNCLEAR only:** Your response must be ONLY the JSON object or the word "UNCLEAR". Do not add any other text, explanations, or formatting.

    4.  **One Question at a Time:** Do not ask for more than one piece of information at a time.
    5.  **Personalize:** Address the user, sid, by their name when it feels natural.

    Act as a "Master Intent Architect". Your primary job is to analyze a user's request and create a detailed, structured schema for it. This schema is the plan for a conversation.

    Conversation History:
    user: i'm looking for a contract manufacturer

    Based on the user's goal, generate a single, valid JSON object that defines the intent schema.
    The JSON object must have this structure:
    {
      "intentName": "PascalCaseName_v1",
      "displayName": "User-Friendly Name",
      "description": "A brief summary of what the user wants to do.",
      "slots": [
        { "name": "camelCaseSlotName", "type": "string|number|enum", "required": true|false, "options": ["option1"] (if type is 'enum') }
      ]
    }

    **CRITICAL RULES:**
    1.  **Be Thorough:** For any real-world task (e.g., finding a tutor, selling an item, booking a trip), you MUST define at least two `required` slots. Do not create trivial schemas. Think about what information is absolutely essential for the task.
    2.  **No Goal, No Schema:** If the conversation is a simple greeting (e.g., "hi", "hello") or has no clear actionable goal, respond with the exact string "UNCLEAR".
    3.  **JSON or UNCLEAR only:** Your response must be ONLY the JSON object or the word "UNCLEAR". Do not add any other text, explanations, or formatting.
    
    Example for "Find a tutor for advanced calculus":
    {
      "intentName": "FindTutor_v1",

    Act as a "Master Intent Architect". Your primary job is to analyze a user's request and create a detailed, structured schema for it. This schema is the plan for a conversation.

    Conversation History:
    user: i am looking for a boutique tailor

    Based on the user's goal, generate a single, valid JSON object that defines the intent schema.
    The JSON object must have this structure:
    {
      "intentName": "PascalCaseName_v1",
      "displayName": "User-Friendly Name",
      "description": "A brief summary of what the user wants to do.",
      "slots": [
        { "name": "camelCaseSlotName", "type": "string|number|enum", "required": true|false, "options": ["option1"] (if type is 'enum') }
      ]
    }

    **CRITICAL RULES:**
    1.  **Be Thorough:** For any real-world task (e.g., finding a tutor, selling an item, booking a trip), you MUST define at least two `required` slots. Do not create trivial schemas. Think about what information is absolutely essential for the task.
    2.  **No Goal, No Schema:** If the conversation is a simple greeting (e.g., "hi", "hello") or has no clear actionable goal, respond with the exact string "UNCLEAR".
    3.  **JSON or UNCLEAR only:** Your response must be ONLY the JSON object or the word "UNCLEAR". Do not add any other text, explanations, or formatting.
    
    Example for "Find a tutor for advanced calculus":
    {
      "intentName": "FindTutor_v1",
      "displayName": "Find a Tutor",
      "description": "User is looking for a tutor for a specific subject.",
      "slots": [
        { "name": "subject", "type": "string", "required": true },
        { "name": "level", "type": "string", "required": true },
        { "name": "sessionType", "type": "enum", "required": true, "options": ["online", "in-person"] },
        { "name": "budget", "type": "string", "required": false }
      ]

    Your task is to determine the most logical next question to ask to continue filling the form.

    Instructions:
    1.  **Prioritize Required Information:** First, check if any 'required' slots from the schema are missing from the conversation. If so, ask a friendly question for the very next missing *required* slot.
    2.  **Continue with Optional Information:** If all 'required' slots are filled, check for any 'optional' (required: false) slots that are missing. If there are any, ask a friendly question for the next single *optional* slot.
    3.  **Signal Completion:** Only when all slots (both required and optional) have been filled, or if the user indicates they don't want to provide more optional details, respond with the exact machine-readable string "ALL_SLOTS_FILLED".
    4.  **One Question at a Time:** Do not ask for more than one piece of information at a time.
    5.  **Personalize:** Address the user, sid, by their name when it feels natural.
    6.  Your response must ONLY be the AI's conversational question or the "ALL_SLOTS_FILLED" string.

    Act as a "Master Intent Architect". Your primary job is to analyze a user's request and create a detailed, structured schema for it. This schema is the plan for a conversation.

    Conversation History:
    user: hi, i am looking for an intern to work on an app idea that i have

    Based on the user's goal, generate a single, valid JSON object that defines the intent schema.
    The JSON object must have this structure:
    {
      "intentName": "PascalCaseName_v1",
      "displayName": "User-Friendly Name",
      "description": "A brief summary of what the user wants to do.",
      "slots": [
        { "name": "camelCaseSlotName", "type": "string|number|enum", "required": true|false, "options": ["option1"] (if type is 'enum') }
      ]
    }

    **CRITICAL RULES:**
    1.  **Be Thorough:** For any real-world task (e.g., finding a tutor, selling an item, booking a trip), you MUST define at least two `required` slots. Do not create trivial schemas. Think about what information is absolutely essential for the task.
    2.  **No Goal, No Schema:** If the conversation is a simple greeting (e.g., "hi", "hello") or has no clear actionable goal, respond with the exact string "UNCLEAR".
    3.  **JSON or UNCLEAR only:** Your response must be ONLY the JSON object or the word "UNCLEAR". Do not add any other text, explanations, or formatting.

    Respond with a single, valid JSON object containing only the "filledSlots" key.
    Example: { "filledSlots": { "slotName1": "value1", "slotName2": 123 } }
    - Ensure data types match the slot definitions.
    - If you cannot extract a value for a slot, omit it from the JSON.
    - Your response must ONLY be the JSON object. If no slots can be filled, return an empty filledSlots object.

    2.  **Continue with Optional Information:** If all 'required' slots are filled, check for any 'optional' (required: false) slots that are missing. If there are any, ask a friendly question for the next single *optional* slot.
    3.  **Signal Completion:** Only when all slots (both required and optional) have been filled, or if the user indicates they don't want to provide more optional details, respond with the exact machine-readable string "ALL_SLOTS_FILLED".

    Act as a "Master Intent Architect". Your primary job is to analyze a user's request and create a detailed, structured schema for it. This schema is the plan for a conversation.

    Conversation History:
    user: hi can you help me find an intern?

    Based on the user's goal, generate a single, valid JSON object that defines the intent schema.
    The JSON object must have this structure:
    {
      "intentName": "PascalCaseName_v1",
      "displayName": "User-Friendly Name",
      "description": "A brief summary of what the user wants to do.",
      "slots": [
        { "name": "camelCaseSlotName", "type": "string|number|enum", "required": true|false, "options": ["option1"] (if type is 'enum') }
      ]
    }

    **CRITICAL RULES:**
    1.  **Be Thorough:** For any real-world task (e.g., finding a tutor, selling an item, booking a trip), you MUST define at least two `required` slots. Do not create trivial schemas. Think about what information is absolutely essential for the task.
    2.  **No Goal, No Schema:** If the conversation is a simple greeting (e.g., "hi", "hello") or has no clear actionable goal, respond with the exact string "UNCLEAR".
    3.  **JSON or UNCLEAR only:** Your response must be ONLY the JSON object or the word "UNCLEAR". Do not add any other text, explanations, or formatting.

    Act as a "Master Intent Architect". Your primary job is to analyze a user's request and create a detailed, structured schema for it. This schema is the plan for a conversation.

    Conversation History:
    user: i have a factory that manufacturers water bottles. i am looking for clients.

    Based on the user's goal, generate a single, valid JSON object that defines the intent schema.
    The JSON object must have this structure:
    {
      "intentName": "PascalCaseName_v1",
      "displayName": "User-Friendly Name",
      "description": "A user-centric summary of the goal. Start with 'User wants to...' or 'User is looking for...'.",

        { "name": "camelCaseSlotName", "type": "string|number|enum", "required": true|false, "options": ["option1"] (if type is 'enum') }
      ]
    }

    **CRITICAL RULES:**
    1.  **Be Thorough:** For any real-world task (e.g., finding a tutor, selling an item, booking a trip), you MUST define at least two `required` slots. Do not create trivial schemas. Think about what information is absolutely essential for the task.
    2.  **No Goal, No Schema:** If the conversation is a simple greeting (e.g., "hi", "hello") or has no clear actionable goal, respond with the exact string "UNCLEAR".
    3.  **JSON or UNCLEAR only:** Your response must be ONLY the JSON object or the word "UNCLEAR". Do not add any other text, explanations, or formatting.

    Act as a "Master Intent Architect". Your primary job is to analyze a user's request and create a detailed, structured schema for it. This schema is the plan for a conversation.

    Conversation History:
    user: i am looking for a handyman for a few hours over the weekend

    Based on the user's goal, generate a single, valid JSON object that defines the intent schema.
    The JSON object must have this structure:
    {
      "intentName": "PascalCaseName_v1",
      "displayName": "User-Friendly Name",
      "description": "A user-centric summary of the goal. Start with 'User wants to...' or 'User is looking for...'.",
      "slots": [
        { "name": "camelCaseSlotName", "type": "string|number|enum", "required": true|false, "options": ["option1"] (if type is 'enum') }
      ]
    }

    **CRITICAL RULES:**
    1.  **Be Thorough:** For any real-world task (e.g., finding a tutor, selling an item, booking a trip), you MUST define at least two `required` slots. Do not create trivial schemas. Think about what information is absolutely essential for the task.
    2.  **No Goal, No Schema:** If the conversation is a simple greeting (e.g., "hi", "hello") or has no clear actionable goal, respond with the exact string "UNCLEAR".
    3.  **JSON or UNCLEAR only:** Your response must be ONLY the JSON object or the word "UNCLEAR". Do not add any other text, explanations, or formatting.

    Instructions:
    1.  **Prioritize Required Information:** First, check if any 'required' slots from the schema are missing from the conversation. If so, ask a friendly question for the very next missing *required* slot.
    2.  **Continue with Optional Information:** If all 'required' slots are filled, check for any 'optional' (required: false) slots that are missing. If there are any, ask a friendly question for the next single *optional* slot.
    3.  **Signal Completion:** Only when all slots (both required and optional) have been filled, or if the user indicates they don't want to provide more optional details, respond with the exact machine-readable string "ALL_SLOTS_FILLED".
    4.  **One Question at a Time:** Do not ask for more than one piece of information at a time.
    5.  **Personalize:** Address the user, sid, by their name when it feels natural.

    You are an empathetic, friendly, and helpful AI assistant. Your tone should be helpful and understanding. You are speaking with a user named 'sid'.

    Your main goal is to help sid complete a task by filling out a form based on this JSON schema:
    {"intentName": "FindHandyman_v1", "displayName": "Find a Handyman", "description": "User is looking for a handyman service for specific tasks, duration, and time.", "slots": [{"name": "serviceDuration", "type": "string", "required": true}, {"name": "preferredTiming", "type": "string", "required": true}, {"name": "serviceLocation", "type": "string", "required": true}, {"name": "taskDescription", "type": "string", "required": true}]}

    This is the information you have confirmed so far:
    {"serviceDuration": "a few hours", "preferredTiming": "over the weekend", "serviceLocation": "at my house", "taskDescription": "moving lawn and moving a few pieces of furniture"}

    This is the full conversation history:
    user: i am looking for a handyman for a few hours over the weekend
model: And where would you need the handyman service, sid?
user: at my house
model: And what kind of tasks would you need the handyman to help with, sid?
user: moving lawn and moving a few pieces of furniture

    Your task is to determine the most logical next question to ask to continue filling the form.

    Instructions:
    1.  **Prioritize Required Information:** First, check if any 'required' slots from the schema are missing from the conversation. If so, ask a friendly question for the very next missing *required* slot.
    2.  **Continue with Optional Information:** If all 'required' slots are filled, check for any 'optional' (required: false) slots that are missing. If there are any, ask a friendly question for the next single *optional* slot.
    3.  **Signal Completion:** Only when all slots (both required and optional) have been filled, or if the user indicates they don't want to provide more optional details, respond with the exact machine-readable string "ALL_SLOTS_FILLED".
    4.  **One Question at a Time:** Do not ask for more than one piece of information at a time.
    5.  **Personalize:** Address the user, sid, by their name when it feels natural.
    6.  Your response must ONLY be the AI's conversational question or the "ALL_SLOTS_FILLED" string.

    You are an AI assistant. Your task is to summarize the details you've collected from the user, sid, and ask for their confirmation before proceeding.

    First, state the user's main goal, which is: "User is looking for a handyman service for specific tasks, duration, and time.".

    Here are the details:
    - Serviceduration: a few hours

    Act as a "Master Intent Architect". Your primary job is to analyze a user's request and create a detailed, structured schema for it. This schema is the plan for a conversation.

    Conversation History:
    user: i am looking for a handyman for a few hours over the weekend
model: And where would you need the handyman service, sid?
user: at my house
model: And what kind of tasks would you need the handyman to help with, sid?
user: moving lawn and moving a few pieces of furniture
model: Okay sid, let's confirm. It looks like your main goal is: "User is looking for a handyman service for specific tasks, duration, and time."

Based on our chat, here are the details I have:
-   **Serviceduration:** a few hours
-   **Preferredtiming:** over the weekend
-   **Servicelocation:** at my house
-   **Taskdescription:** moving lawn and moving a few pieces of furniture

Is that all correct, or would you like to make any changes?
user: instead of at my house, mention, hi-tech city, hyderabad

    Based on the user's goal, generate a single, valid JSON object that defines the intent schema.
    The JSON object must have this structure:
    {
      "intentName": "PascalCaseName_v1",
      "displayName": "User-Friendly Name",
      "description": "A user-centric summary of the goal. Start with 'User wants to...' or 'User is looking for...'.",
      "slots": [
        { "name": "camelCaseSlotName", "type": "string|number|enum", "required": true|false, "options": ["option1"] (if type is 'enum') }
      ]
    }

    **CRITICAL RULES:**
    1.  **Be Thorough:** For any real-world task (e.g., finding a tutor, selling an item, booking a trip), you MUST define at least two `required` slots. Do not create trivial schemas. Think about what information is absolutely essential for the task.
    2.  **No Goal, No Schema:** If the conversation is a simple greeting (e.g., "hi", "hello") or has no clear actionable goal, respond with the exact string "UNCLEAR".
    3.  **JSON or UNCLEAR only:** Your response must be ONLY the JSON object or the word "UNCLEAR". Do not add any other text, explanations, or formatting.

    Act as a "Master Intent Architect". Your primary job is to analyze a user's request and create a detailed, structured schema for it. This schema is the plan for a conversation.

    Conversation History:
    user: i am looking to buy a crm software

    Based on the user's goal, generate a single, valid JSON object that defines the intent schema.
    The JSON object must have this structure:
    {
      "intentName": "PascalCaseName_v1",
      "displayName": "User-Friendly Name",
      "description": "A user-centric summary of the goal. Start with 'User wants to...' or 'User is looking for...'.",
      "slots": [
        { "name": "camelCaseSlotName", "type": "string|number|enum", "required": true|false, "options": ["option1"] (if type is 'enum') }
      ]
    }

    **CRITICAL RULES:**
    1.  **Be Thorough:** For any real-world task (e.g., finding a tutor, selling an item, booking a trip), you MUST define at least two `required` slots. Do not create trivial schemas. Think about what information is absolutely essential for the task.
    2.  **No Goal, No Schema:** If the conversation is a simple greeting (e.g., "hi", "hello") or has no clear actionable goal, respond with the exact string "UNCLEAR".
    3.  **JSON or UNCLEAR only:** Your response must be ONLY the JSON object or the word "UNCLEAR". Do not add any other text, explanations, or formatting.

    Act as a "Master Intent Architect". Your primary job is to analyze a user's request and create a detailed, structured schema for it. This schema is the plan for a conversation.

user: 5 users
model: Great! Thanks for letting me know, sid. To help me narrow down the best options for you, could you give me an idea of your budget range for this CRM software?
user: would not like to reveal, would like to get offer from vendors
model: Could you share what industry your company is in, sid? This can help us find CRM solutions that are a good fit for your specific needs.

model: And lastly, sid, do you have a preference for how the CRM software is deployed? For example, would you prefer it to be cloud-based, on-premise (installed on your own servers), or a hybrid of both?
user: cloud-based
model: Okay sid, let's confirm. It looks like your goal is to "User is looking to purchase customer relationship management (CRM) software to manage customer interactions and sales processes."

Based on our chat, here are the details I have:
*   Number of users: 5
*   Primary goal: Buy CRM Software
*   Industry type: dental clinic
*   Deployment type: cloud-based

Is that all correct, or would you like to make any changes?
user: also add, we are looking for a vendor which offers annual amc
model: Understood. Thanks for the correction. Let me re-evaluate based on your changes. One moment...
user: yes?

    Based on the user's goal, generate a single, valid JSON object that defines the intent schema.
    The JSON object must have this structure:
    {
      "intentName": "PascalCaseName_v1",
      "displayName": "User-Friendly Name",
      "description": "A user-centric summary of the goal. Start with 'User wants to...' or 'User is looking for...'.",
      "slots": [
        { "name": "camelCaseSlotName", "type": "string|number|enum", "required": true|false, "options": ["option1"] (if type is 'enum') }
      ]
    }

    **CRITICAL RULES:**
    1.  **Be Thorough:** For any real-world task (e.g., finding a tutor, selling an item, booking a trip), you MUST define at least two `required` slots. Do not create trivial schemas. Think about what information is absolutely essential for the task.
    2.  **No Goal, No Schema:** If the conversation is a simple greeting (e.g., "hi", "hello") or has no clear actionable goal, respond with the exact string "UNCLEAR".
    3.  **JSON or UNCLEAR only:** Your response must be ONLY the JSON object or the word "UNCLEAR". Do not add any other text, explanations, or formatting.

    Your task is to determine the most logical next question to ask to continue filling the form.

    Instructions:
    1.  **Prioritize Required Information:** First, check if any 'required' slots from the schema are missing from the conversation. If so, ask a friendly question for the very next missing *required* slot.
    2.  **Continue with Optional Information:** If all 'required' slots are filled, check for any 'optional' (required: false) slots that are missing. If there are any, ask a friendly question for the next single *optional* slot.
    3.  **Signal Completion:** Only when all slots (both required and optional) have been filled, or if the user indicates they don't want to provide more optional details, respond with the exact machine-readable string "ALL_SLOTS_FILLED".
    4.  **One Question at a Time:** Do not ask for more than one piece of information at a time.
    5.  **Personalize:** Address the user, sid, by their name when it feels natural.
    6.  Your response must ONLY be the AI's conversational question or the "ALL_SLOTS_FILLED" string.

    Act as a "Master Intent Architect". Your primary job is to analyze a user's request and create a detailed, structured schema for it. This schema is the plan for a conversation.

    Conversation History:
    user: i am looking for a job as data scientist. i have 13 years of experience and have worked at major corporations. i am looking for a remote option and i'm ready to join within 15 days of notice period

    Based on the user's goal, generate a single, valid JSON object that defines the intent schema.
    The JSON object must have this structure:
    {
      "intentName": "PascalCaseName_v1",
      "displayName": "User-Friendly Name",
      "description": "A user-centric summary of the goal. Start with 'User wants to...' or 'User is looking for...'.",
      "slots": [
        { "name": "camelCaseSlotName", "type": "string|number|enum", "required": true|false, "options": ["option1"] (if type is 'enum') }
      ]
    }

    **CRITICAL RULES:**
    1.  **Be Thorough:** For any real-world task (e.g., finding a tutor, selling an item, booking a trip), you MUST define at least two `required` slots. Do not create trivial schemas. Think about what information is absolutely essential for the task.
    2.  **No Goal, No Schema:** If the conversation is a simple greeting (e.g., "hi", "hello") or has no clear actionable goal, respond with the exact string "UNCLEAR".
    3.  **JSON or UNCLEAR only:** Your response must be ONLY the JSON object or the word "UNCLEAR". Do not add any other text, explanations, or formatting.

    Act as a "Master Intent Architect". Your primary job is to analyze a user's request and create a detailed, structured schema for it. This schema is the plan for a conversation.

    Conversation History:
    user: I'm looking for a yoga teacher

    Based on the user's goal, generate a single, valid JSON object that defines the intent schema.
    The JSON object must have this structure:
    {
      "intentName": "PascalCaseName_v1",
      "displayName": "User-Friendly Name",
      "description": "A user-centric summary of the goal. Start with 'User wants to...' or 'User is looking for...'.",
      "slots": [
        { "name": "camelCaseSlotName", "type": "string|number|enum", "required": true|false, "options": ["option1"] (if type is 'enum') }
      ]
    }

    **CRITICAL RULES:**
    1.  **Be Thorough:** For any real-world task (e.g., finding a tutor, selling an item, booking a trip), you MUST define at least two `required` slots. Do not create trivial schemas. Think about what information is absolutely essential for the task.
    2.  **No Goal, No Schema:** If the conversation is a simple greeting (e.g., "hi", "hello") or has no clear actionable goal, respond with the exact string "UNCLEAR".
    3.  **JSON or UNCLEAR only:** Your response must be ONLY the JSON object or the word "UNCLEAR". Do not add any other text, explanations, or formatting.

    Your task is to determine the most logical next question to ask to continue filling the form.

    Instructions:
    1.  **Prioritize Required Information:** First, check if any 'required' slots from the schema are missing from the conversation. If so, ask a friendly question for the very next missing *required* slot.
    2.  **Continue with Optional Information:** If all 'required' slots are filled, check for any 'optional' (required: false) slots that are missing. If there are any, ask a friendly question for the next single *optional* slot.
    3.  **Signal Completion:** Only when all slots (both required and optional) have been filled, or if the user indicates they don't want to provide more optional details, respond with the exact machine-readable string "ALL_SLOTS_FILLED".
    4.  **One Question at a Time:** Do not ask for more than one piece of information at a time.
    5.  **Personalize:** Address the user, shwetha, by their name when it feels natural.
    6.  Your response must ONLY be the AI's conversational question or the "ALL_SLOTS_FILLED" string.

    Act as a "Master Intent Architect". Your primary job is to analyze a user's request and create a detailed, structured schema for it. This schema is the plan for a conversation.

    Conversation History:
    user: i want to sell bags of coffee from my plantation

    Based on the user's goal, generate a single, valid JSON object that defines the intent schema.
    The JSON object must have this structure:
    {
      "intentName": "PascalCaseName_v1",
      "displayName": "User-Friendly Name",
      "description": "A user-centric summary of the goal. Start with 'User wants to...' or 'User is looking for...'.",
      "slots": [
        { "name": "camelCaseSlotName", "type": "string|number|enum", "required": true|false, "options": ["option1"] (if type is 'enum') }
      ]
    }

    **CRITICAL RULES:**
    1.  **Be Thorough:** For any real-world task (e.g., finding a tutor, selling an item, booking a trip), you MUST define at least two `required` slots. Do not create trivial schemas. Think about what information is absolutely essential for the task.
    2.  **No Goal, No Schema:** If the conversation is a simple greeting (e.g., "hi", "hello") or has no clear actionable goal, respond with the exact string "UNCLEAR".
    3.  **JSON or UNCLEAR only:** Your response must be ONLY the JSON object or the word "UNCLEAR". Do not add any other text, explanations, or formatting.

    Your main goal is to help bablu complete a task by filling out a form based on this JSON schema:
    {"intentName": "SellCoffeeFromPlantation_v1", "displayName": "Sell Coffee from My Plantation", "description": "User wants to sell bags of coffee directly from their plantation, specifying quantity, unit, price, origin, and preferred contact method.", "slots": [{"name": "quantity", "type": "number", "required": true}, {"name": "unit", "type": "enum", "required": true, "options": ["bag", "bags", "kg", "lbs"]}, {"name": "pricePerUnit", "type": "number", "required": true}, {"name": "productOrigin", "type": "string", "required": true}, {"name": "contactMethod", "type": "enum", "required": true, "options": ["email", "phone", "whatsapp"]}, {"name": "coffeeType", "type": "string", "required": false}, {"name": "roastLevel", "type": "enum", "required": false, "options": ["light", "medium", "dark", "unroasted"]}]}

    This is the full conversation history:
    user: i want to sell bags of coffee from my plantation
model: That sounds great, bablu! To help you sell your coffee, how many bags of coffee would you like to sell?
user: 500 bags, each bag is a 100kg
model: Thank you, bablu! That's helpful to know the weight per bag.

Now, what price would you like to sell each bag for?
user: what is the approximate price range for an arabic coffee
model: That's a good question, bablu! I can't provide specific market pricing, but once you've decided on a price, what would you like to sell each bag for?

    Your task is to determine the most logical next question to ask to continue filling the form.

    Instructions:
    1.  **Prioritize Required Information:** First, check if any 'required' slots from the schema are missing from the conversation. If so, ask a friendly question for the very next missing *required* slot.
    2.  **Continue with Optional Information:** If all 'required' slots are filled, check for any 'optional' (required: false) slots that are missing. If there are any, ask a friendly question for the next single *optional* slot.
    3.  **Signal Completion:** Only when all slots (both required and optional) have been filled, or if the user indicates they don't want to provide more optional details, respond with the exact machine-readable string "ALL_SLOTS_FILLED".
    4.  **One Question at a Time:** Do not ask for more than one piece of information at a time.
    5.  **Personalize:** Address the user, bablu, by their name when it feels natural.
    6.  Your response must ONLY be the AI's conversational question or the "ALL_SLOTS_FILLED" string.

    Act as a "Master Intent Architect". Your primary job is to analyze a user's request and create a detailed, structured schema for it. This schema is the plan for a conversation.

    Conversation History:
    user: i want to buy scrap

    Based on the user's goal, generate a single, valid JSON object that defines the intent schema.
    The JSON object must have this structure:
    {
      "intentName": "PascalCaseName_v1",
      "displayName": "User-Friendly Name",
      "description": "A user-centric summary of the goal. Start with 'User wants to...' or 'User is looking for...'.",
      "slots": [
        { "name": "camelCaseSlotName", "type": "string|number|enum", "required": true|false, "options": ["option1"] (if type is 'enum') }
      ]
    }

    **CRITICAL RULES:**
    1.  **Be Thorough:** For any real-world task (e.g., finding a tutor, selling an item, booking a trip), you MUST define at least two `required` slots. Do not create trivial schemas. Think about what information is absolutely essential for the task.
    2.  **No Goal, No Schema:** If the conversation is a simple greeting (e.g., "hi", "hello") or has no clear actionable goal, respond with the exact string "UNCLEAR".
    3.  **JSON or UNCLEAR only:** Your response must be ONLY the JSON object or the word "UNCLEAR". Do not add any other text, explanations, or formatting.

    Act as a "Master Intent Architect". Your primary job is to analyze a user's request and create a detailed, structured schema for it. This schema is the plan for a conversation.

    Conversation History:
    user: hi

    Based on the user's goal, generate a single, valid JSON object that defines the intent schema.
    The JSON object must have this structure:
    {
      "intentName": "PascalCaseName_v1",
      "displayName": "User-Friendly Name",
      "description": "A user-centric summary of the goal. Start with 'User wants to...' or 'User is looking for...'.",
      "slots": [
        { "name": "camelCaseSlotName", "type": "string|number|enum", "required": true|false, "options": ["option1"] (if type is 'enum') }
      ]
    }

    **CRITICAL RULES:**
    1.  **Be Thorough:** For any real-world task (e.g., finding a tutor, selling an item, booking a trip), you MUST define at least two `required` slots. Do not create trivial schemas. Think about what information is absolutely essential for the task.
    2.  **No Goal, No Schema:** If the conversation is a simple greeting (e.g., "hi", "hello") or has no clear actionable goal, respond with the exact string "UNCLEAR".
    3.  **JSON or UNCLEAR only:** Your response must be ONLY the JSON object or the word "UNCLEAR". Do not add any other text, explanations, or formatting.

    Act as a "Master Intent Architect". Your primary job is to analyze a user's request and create a detailed, structured schema for it. This schema is the plan for a conversation.

user: change the goal to 'i am looking for... ' instead of 'user is ...' also add that i need help for 7 days
model: Understood. Thanks for the correction. Let me re-evaluate based on your changes. One moment...
user: yes

    Based on the user's goal, generate a single, valid JSON object that defines the intent schema.
    The JSON object must have this structure:
    {
      "intentName": "PascalCaseName_v1",
      "displayName": "User-Friendly Name",
      "description": "A user-centric summary of the goal. Start with 'User wants to...' or 'User is looking for...'.",
      "slots": [
        { "name": "camelCaseSlotName", "type": "string|number|enum", "required": true|false, "options": ["option1"] (if type is 'enum') }
      ]
    }

    **CRITICAL RULES:**
    1.  **Be Thorough:** For any real-world task (e.g., finding a tutor, selling an item, booking a trip), you MUST define at least two `required` slots. Do not create trivial schemas. Think about what information is absolutely essential for the task.
    2.  **No Goal, No Schema:** If the conversation is a simple greeting (e.g., "hi", "hello") or has no clear actionable goal, respond with the exact string "UNCLEAR".
    3.  **JSON or UNCLEAR only:** Your response must be ONLY the JSON object or the word "UNCLEAR". Do not add any other text, explanations, or formatting.

    1.  **Be Thorough:** For any real-world task (e.g., finding a tutor, selling an item, booking a trip), you MUST define at least two `required` slots. Do not create trivial schemas. Think about what information is absolutely essential for the task.
    2.  **No Goal, No Schema:** If the conversation is a simple greeting (e.g., "hi", "hello") or has no clear actionable goal, respond with the exact string "UNCLEAR".
    3.  **JSON or UNCLEAR only:** Your response must be ONLY the JSON object or the word "UNCLEAR". Do not add any other text, explanations, or formatting.

    Act as a "Master Intent Architect". Your primary job is to analyze a user's request and create a detailed, structured schema for it. This schema is the plan for a conversation.

    Conversation History:
    user: i am looking for a full stack developer with skills in backend and frontend

    Based on the user's goal, generate a single, valid JSON object that defines the intent schema.
    The JSON object must have this structure:
    {
      "intentName": "PascalCaseName_v1",
      "displayName": "User-Friendly Name",
      "description": "A user-centric summary of the goal. Start with 'User wants to...' or 'User is looking for...'.",
      "slots": [
        { "name": "camelCaseSlotName", "type": "string|number|enum", "required": true|false, "options": ["option1"] (if type is 'enum') }
      ]
    }

    **CRITICAL RULES:**
    1.  **Be Thorough:** For any real-world task (e.g., finding a tutor, selling an item, booking a trip), you MUST define at least two `required` slots. Do not create trivial schemas. Think about what information is absolutely essential for the task.
    2.  **No Goal, No Schema:** If the conversation is a simple greeting (e.g., "hi", "hello") or has no clear actionable goal, respond with the exact string "UNCLEAR".
    3.  **JSON or UNCLEAR only:** Your response must be ONLY the JSON object or the word "UNCLEAR". Do not add any other text, explanations, or formatting.

    Your main goal is to help shwetha complete a task by filling out a form based on this JSON schema:
    {"intentName": "FindDeveloper_v1", "displayName": "Find a Developer", "description": "User is looking for a developer for a specific role with particular skills, experience, and preferred engagement and location.", "slots": [{"name": "developerRole", "type": "enum", "required": true, "options": ["full stack", "frontend", "backend", "mobile", "devops", "qa", "data scientist", "AI/ML engineer"]}, {"name": "skillCategories", "type": "string", "required": true}, {"name": "experienceLevel", "type": "enum", "required": true, "options": ["junior", "mid-level", "senior", "lead", "architect"]}, {"name": "engagementType", "type": "enum", "required": true, "options": ["full-time", "part-time", "contract", "freelance"]}, {"name": "locationPreference", "type": "enum", "required": true, "options": ["remote", "on-site", "hybrid"]}]}

    This is the information you have confirmed so far:
    {"developerRole": "full stack", "skillCategories": "backend, frontend, node.js, react.js", "experienceLevel": "senior", "engagementType": "full-time", "locationPreference": "remote"}

    This is the full conversation history:
    user: i am looking for a full stack developer with skills in backend and frontend
model: Thanks for letting me know, shwetha! To help me find the best fit, what experience level are you looking for in this developer? For example, are you looking for a junior, mid-level, senior, lead, or architect?
user: senior
model: Great, thank you for confirming, shwetha! What type of engagement are you looking for? For example, full-time, part-time, contract, or freelance?
user: full-time, and should have skills in node.js and react.js
model: Thanks for that, shwetha! Just one more thing to confirm: What is your preferred location for this developer? Are you looking for someone remote, on-site, or hybrid?
user: remote is ok

    Your task is to determine the most logical next question to ask to continue filling the form.

    Instructions:
    1.  **Prioritize Required Information:** First, check if any 'required' slots from the schema are missing from the conversation. If so, ask a friendly question for the very next missing *required* slot.
    2.  **Continue with Optional Information:** If all 'required' slots are filled, check for any 'optional' (required: false) slots that are missing. If there are any, ask a friendly question for the next single *optional* slot.
    3.  **Signal Completion:** Only when all slots (both required and optional) have been filled, or if the user indicates they don't want to provide more optional details, respond with the exact machine-readable string "ALL_SLOTS_FILLED".
    4.  **One Question at a Time:** Do not ask for more than one piece of information at a time.
    5.  **Personalize:** Address the user, shwetha, by their name when it feels natural.
    6.  Your response must ONLY be the AI's conversational question or the "ALL_SLOTS_FILLED" string.

    Act as a "Master Intent Architect". Your primary job is to analyze a user's request and create a detailed, structured schema for it. This schema is the plan for a conversation.

    Conversation History:
    user: i'm looking to buy a restaurant business

    Based on the user's goal, generate a single, valid JSON object that defines the intent schema.
    The JSON object must have this structure:
    {
      "intentName": "PascalCaseName_v1",
      "displayName": "User-Friendly Name",
      "description": "A user-centric summary of the goal. Start with 'User wants to...' or 'User is looking for...'.",
      "slots": [
        { "name": "camelCaseSlotName", "type": "string|number|enum", "required": true|false, "options": ["option1"] (if type is 'enum') }
      ]
    }

    **CRITICAL RULES:**
    1.  **Be Thorough:** For any real-world task (e.g., finding a tutor, selling an item, booking a trip), you MUST define at least two `required` slots. Do not create trivial schemas. Think about what information is absolutely essential for the task.
    2.  **No Goal, No Schema:** If the conversation is a simple greeting (e.g., "hi", "hello") or has no clear actionable goal, respond with the exact string "UNCLEAR".
    3.  **JSON or UNCLEAR only:** Your response must be ONLY the JSON object or the word "UNCLEAR". Do not add any other text, explanations, or formatting.

    Instructions:
    1.  **Prioritize Required Information:** First, check if any 'required' slots from the schema are missing from the conversation. If so, ask a friendly question for the very next missing *required* slot.
    2.  **Continue with Optional Information:** If all 'required' slots are filled, check for any 'optional' (required: false) slots that are missing. If there are any, ask a friendly question for the next single *optional* slot.
    3.  **Signal Completion:** Only when all slots (both required and optional) have been filled, or if the user indicates they don't want to provide more optional details, respond with the exact machine-readable string "ALL_SLOTS_FILLED".
    4.  **One Question at a Time:** Do not ask for more than one piece of information at a time.
    5.  **Personalize:** Address the user, sid, by their name when it feels natural.

    Act as a "Master Intent Architect". Your primary job is to analyze a user's request and create a detailed, structured schema for it. This schema is the plan for a conversation.

    Conversation History:
    user: looking for a used dslr camera in good to excellent condition

    Based on the user's goal, generate a single, valid JSON object that defines the intent schema.
    The JSON object must have this structure:
    {
      "intentName": "PascalCaseName_v1",
      "displayName": "User-Friendly Name",
      "description": "A user-centric summary of the goal. Start with 'User wants to...' or 'User is looking for...'.",
      "slots": [
        { "name": "camelCaseSlotName", "type": "string|number|enum", "required": true|false, "options": ["option1"] (if type is 'enum') }
      ]
    }

    **CRITICAL RULES:**
    1.  **Be Thorough:** For any real-world task (e.g., finding a tutor, selling an item, booking a trip), you MUST define at least two `required` slots. Do not create trivial schemas. Think about what information is absolutely essential for the task.
    2.  **No Goal, No Schema:** If the conversation is a simple greeting (e.g., "hi", "hello") or has no clear actionable goal, respond with the exact string "UNCLEAR".
    3.  **JSON or UNCLEAR only:** Your response must be ONLY the JSON object or the word "UNCLEAR". Do not add any other text, explanations, or formatting.

    Your task is to determine the most logical next question to ask to continue filling the form.

    Instructions:
    1.  **Prioritize Required Information:** First, check if any 'required' slots from the schema are missing from the conversation. If so, ask a friendly question for the very next missing *required* slot.
    2.  **Continue with Optional Information:** If all 'required' slots are filled, check for any 'optional' (required: false) slots that are missing. If there are any, ask a friendly question for the next single *optional* slot.
    3.  **Signal Completion:** Only when all slots (both required and optional) have been filled, or if the user indicates they don't want to provide more optional details, respond with the exact machine-readable string "ALL_SLOTS_FILLED".
    4.  **One Question at a Time:** Do not ask for more than one piece of information at a time.
    5.  **Personalize:** Address the user, sid, by their name when it feels natural.
    6.  **Your response must ONLY be the AI's conversational question or the "ALL_SLOTS_FILLED" string.**

    {"intentName": "FindUsedCamera_v1", "displayName": "Find Used Camera", "description": "User is looking for a used camera with specific type and minimum condition requirements, and requires a budget to narrow down search results.", "slots": [{"name": "cameraType", "type": "enum", "required": true, "options": ["dslr", "mirrorless", "pointAndShoot", "film", "mediumFormat", "actionCamera"]}, {"name": "minCondition", "type": "enum", "required": true, "options": ["excellent", "good", "fair", "poor"]}, {"name": "maxPrice", "type": "number", "required": true}]}

    This is the information you have confirmed so far:
    {"cameraType": "dslr", "minCondition": "good", "maxPrice": 15000}

    This is the full conversation history:
    user: looking for a used dslr camera in good to excellent condition
model: To help me narrow down the search, sid, what's the maximum price you're looking to spend on the camera?
user: 15000

    Your task is to determine the most logical next question to ask to continue filling the form.

    Instructions:
    1.  **Prioritize Required Information:** First, check if any 'required' slots from the schema are missing from the conversation. If so, ask a friendly question for the very next missing *required* slot.
    2.  **Continue with Optional Information:** If all 'required' slots are filled, check for any 'optional' (required: false) slots that are missing. If there are any, ask a friendly question for the next single *optional* slot.
    3.  **Signal Completion:** Only when all slots (both required and optional) have been filled, or if the user indicates they don't want to provide more optional details, respond with the exact machine-readable string "ALL_SLOTS_FILLED".
    4.  **One Question at a Time:** Do not ask for more than one piece of information at a time.
    5.  **Personalize:** Address the user, sid, by their name when it feels natural.
    6.  **Your response must ONLY be the AI's conversational question or the "ALL_SLOTS_FILLED" string.**

    You are an AI assistant. Your task is to summarize the details you've collected from the user, sid, and ask for their confirmation before proceeding.

    First, state the user's main goal, which is: "User is looking for a used camera with specific type and minimum condition requirements, and requires a budget to narrow down search results.".
    Then, list the details you have collected.

    Here are the details:
    - Cameratype: dslr
- Mincondition: good
- Maxprice: 15000

    Generate a friendly, conversational summary that includes the user's goal and the details. Then ask sid if this information is correct or if they'd like to make any changes.
    Example: "Okay sid, let's confirm. It looks like your goal is to 'User is looking for a used camera with specific type and minimum condition requirements, and requires a budget to narrow down search results.'. Based on our chat, here are the details I have:
    - Cameratype: dslr
- Mincondition: good
- Maxprice: 15000
    Is that all correct?"
